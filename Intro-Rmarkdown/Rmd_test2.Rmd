```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example: See Figure \@ref(fig:speed).

```{r speed, fig.cap="Histogram of speed"}
hist(cars$speed)
```

See Figure \@ref(fig:dist).

```{r dist, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram of dist"}
hist(cars$dist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` suppresses the printing of the code, `hist(cars$dist)`.

<!-- Instructions begin here 

A report is written in plain English (Author, 2024) without using citationkey, such as [@author2024]. Is it possible to just print the references list?
    
Yes, nocite creates a Bibliography list.

Ensure to indent. Otherwise, it won't compile! 
No need to sort the list.

Check the entry in html. Fix any mistakes in Zotero. 
To convert to a Word file, use as below.

You can use the full path for the bib file.

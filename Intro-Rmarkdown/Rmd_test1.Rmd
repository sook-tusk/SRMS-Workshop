# Introduction

This study investigates A. 

# Embed R code
To embed R code, press **Cmd + Option + I ** in Mac or **Ctrl + Alt + I ** in Windows. 
(also bring up *Command Palette* via `Cmd(Ctrl)+Shift+P`, then type *R Code* in the blank search box to reveal the shortcut)

```{r}

```

Type your code inside the ticks. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
hist(cars$speed)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(cars$dist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` suppresses the printing of the code, `hist(cars$dist)`.

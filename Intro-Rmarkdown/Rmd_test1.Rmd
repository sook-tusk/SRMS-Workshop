# Introduction

This study investigates A. 

# Section 2 title
To embed R code, we press **Ctrl + Alt + I** in Windows, 
or in Mac, **Cmd + Option + I** .
(also in Command Palette, press Ctrl(Cmd)+Shift+P then type R code)

Type your code inside a blank line in the code chunk (between ```{r} and ```). 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
hist(cars$speed)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(cars$dist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` suppresses the printing of the code, `hist(cars$dist)`.

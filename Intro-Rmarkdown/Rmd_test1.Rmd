```

# Introduction

This study investigates A. 

# Section 2 title
To embed R code, we press **Ctrl (Cmd) + Alt + I**.
(also show in Command Palette, Ctrl+Shift+P)

```{r}

```

Type your code inside the ticks. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
hist(cars$speed)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(cars$dist)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` suppresses the printing of the code, `hist(cars$dist)`.

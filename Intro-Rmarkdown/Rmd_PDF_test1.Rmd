Ignore `fancy headers and footers` for now.
The option, `\setcounter{page}{1}` indicates that the title page is not counted in the pagination. 

**Stargazer wouldn't work?**
Incrementally test options. Increase complexity.

For example, first, try with a very simple file, then add fancyhdr.
The tinytex in your system will download
addtional LaTeX packages. Once these work okay, experiment with the code involving the stargazer package.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(stargazer)
```


```{r cars}
model_A <- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
```

Skip the regression results table

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pressure Plot", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
plot(pressure)
```

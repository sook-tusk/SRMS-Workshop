# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(stargazer)
```


```{r cars}
modela <- lm(cars$dist ~ cars$speed)
```

Skip the regression results table for now.

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pressure Plot", fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
plot(pressure)
```

Note: This is a scatterplot illustrating the vapor pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature, which is based on R's built-in dataset, `pressure`. Here's a quick glance.
```{r scatterp, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(pressure), caption = "Scatterplot of xy")
```
In base R graphics, scatterplots can be produced by following the structure, `plot(x, y)`. In this case, a simpler code, `plot(pressure)` is used.  The full syntax should be `plot(x = pressure$temperature, y= pressure$pressure)`.

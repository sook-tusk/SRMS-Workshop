# Markdown prac

Using Visual mode, demonstrate: bold, italic, code, blockquote

Convert to a PDF/Word document now (Access Preview menu). Ensure you are comfortable with Styles in Word. Explain YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) rules.

# Rmarkdown (markdown + R code)

We will extend the functionality of markdown grammar, and add R code and its output. The resulting Rmd(rmarkdown) file will be a combination of text and R outputs. We can increase complexity further by adding images, URLs, and so on.

This exercise will produce a multitude of files!

We will explore Rmd_test1.Rmd first. To add caption for figures, we examine Rmd_test2.Rmd. We then create a Word template to include in the Rmd_test3.Rmd.

# Your turn

Create a blank Rmd file.

How do you create this Rmarkdown file?

In RStudio, go to File \> New file \> R Markdown... When a new window pops up, choose Word as Default Output Format. Click OK.

The default Rmarkdown file looks complex. Delete the text as necessary. Explore the file.

Experiment with Rmd. Convert to HTML, Word, and PDF. Improve the look by tweaking further. Learn code chunk options.

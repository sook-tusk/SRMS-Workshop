# Background
Your data analysis steps typically involve multiple complex stages and you'll be selective in presenting results.

# Sourcing R scripts
One way that facilitates the process is to run the entire cleaning R script file that allows us to load the objects, rather than embedding complex structure of the code. Please note that this is an example only.

**Example**:

```{r, eval = F}
source("P:/path/R-Source-Scripts/Code_to_test1.R") # Specify the full path for an R script
```

**Testing yours**:

```{r, echo = F, message=F}
# Specify the full path for an R script to avoid any erros
source("Code_to_test1.R") 
```

As an R script is run, we now have access to objects (Tables, and Figures) we need to present in a report. Let's imagine that we are presenting a Figure on car speed.

Figure \@ref(fig:p1) displays ...

```{r p1, fig.cap="Histogram of speed in cars data"}
# Figure
p_hist_cars_speed

# Desc stats (specify obj name)
# descstats
```
\newpage

# Use *include_graphics*
Alternatively, you could save individual output in a separate file, and simply insert it in an Rmd file. 

See Figure \@ref(fig:p2).

```{r p2, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%",  fig.cap="Histogram of speed in cars data"}
knitr::include_graphics("hist_cars_speed.png")
```
